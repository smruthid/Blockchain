# Blockchain

## Description

The goal is to create a basic blockchain. The user will be able to add blocks to the blockchain and validate whether the blockchain is valid. In addition, the user will be able to add a difficulty level to the block so it will be more difficult to gennerate and guess the block. 

---

## Installation Guide

The user will need to install Streamlit and the dataclass libraries to run this application
```
pip install streamlit
pip install dataclasses
```

To run this application, please navigate to the Blockchain directory and run the following command
```

```

## Images
Here are a few images of the streamlit application running.
This is what the blockchain should look like when adding a couple blocks:
